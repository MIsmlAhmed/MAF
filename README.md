Model Agnostic implementation for HYPE, SUMMA, and MESH.
This repository is a mix of multiple scripts related to the model-agnostic framework (from the [community workflow](https://github.com/kasra-keshavarz/community-modelling-workflow-training.git) and [FHIMP](https://github.com/ShervanGharari/FHIMP.git) repos).

This repo is created to allow easy access and running of the model agnostic workflow in one place for the three models.
Specifically, instructions in the community workflow are used to install the needed packages/dependencies and for running watershed extraction and model agnostic part. the model specific part (that converts the outputs of the model agnostic component to model inputs) have been adapted from the FHIMP repo.
