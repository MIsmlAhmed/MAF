# Static files for SUMMA Run
These files were copied from the test cases of summa
* *.TBL: are static tables with soil and vegetation parameter (unchanged)
* Model_Output.txt: output control file is an ASCII file that specifies which variables are retained in the SUMMA output files (change if you need to report more variables in the output)
* summa_zBasinParamInfo.txt and summa_zLocalParamInfo.txt: spatially constant parameter values for SUMMA basin parameters (change if the parameters are not in the nc files)
